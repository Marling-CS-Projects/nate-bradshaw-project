# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To investigate the criteria of my project, I created a questionnaire to help assess how well my project hit 5 usability criteria.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | How intuitive is it to create an effective creature?                                                  |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the creature creation controls and options relevant and useful to have and use?                   |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is it interesting to watch the creatures' shenanigans whilst evolving? Is the visual design clear?    |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Were any bugs / lag experienced during the creature creation or evolution?                            |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was the creature creation controls easy to learn and was the evolution easy to follow and understand? |

The results of the questions with explanations and limited analysis (further analysis will be done in evaluation) are below.
