# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

To investigate the criteria of my project, I created a questionnaire to help assess how well my project hit 5 usability criteria.

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the evolution fun to watch and clear?                                                               |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the creature creation controls and options relevant and useful to have and use?                    |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is there a large enough range of options to create a unique evolution scenario?                        |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Were any bugs / lag experienced during the creature creation or evolution?                             |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Were the creature creation controls easy to learn and was the evolution easy to follow and understand? |

The results of the questions with explanations and limited analysis (further analysis will be done in evaluation) are below.

### Effective

For the first question, I am asking if the user if they could see and understand how the creature is moving. The easier to understand the movement the better, as that means the creatures are moving in a more natural and recognisable way. Once again, the majority of users understood this.

For a much more subjective question, I asked the user if they enjoyed watching the creatures movement and evolution. Overall, users said they enjoyed watching the evolution, but the majority of the users felt that a bit more could be done to make the viewing experience more enjoyable.

### Efficient

This question is aimed to see if the user read and understood the instructions on the index page and if they used that knowledge well. The answers gave a 50 / 50 split of users who felt they fully understood the controls and users who felt like they needed a bit more instruction.&#x20;

### Engaging

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I asked this question to both to find out the user's knowledge of the creature creation mechanics and controls alongside if the project inspired the user to create unique creatures to watch evolve.

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/VeOyifCeTv9qE4x0hqqhFcmW0qRX1LC9gMMIzYKi6pRGf-fAmtOoek8QrOeuA2lWXw4xGNfUSmrg0P3a98sM6wY8F1uXsJMi00-uCSl6gbqBzw6lUGwoYFX2SeM4sfIRJBryxwABQmjIxqLIWT4-Lrp0u4aA6vETcCKdkDjx66aNGRDdfRpeMhi-eA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For this simple yes / no question, I asked the user if they felt they observed the neuro-evolution of the creatures. All but one user said they observed improvement from the creatures, and following up with the user who didn't revealed that they only observed around 5 generations, where improvement is much less apparent.

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rEZb93z5OkYmJVhi6lv3hul4jzcrDHpJcnrlbS3dfPi83MiqPYwKLEIYU20LojL3jAZ7LQn5nOy6RY4f5Ro0t2M1fFhFeewVwWuKrXsni85G84wGdNRkG7vxRtH53nH36pC50DPo3qJMFUc6S1qMfi1PJMtN2100YQQJzGas_jHQH4kUoNlWXIA8IZoywQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Finally, I asked the user if they found the time control intuitive, which was very important as it was the main way for the user to interact with the simulation after it has started. The responses to this question were all positive, indicating that the text on the canvas alongside the slider were easy to understand and use.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Y5ePryoyTNdsX8dWxHF4JsCT_Q1lIP9sRov_aDPkcZWiIU7zQ806ZQs3-Cxt3FIGo7hHBsD-mAdkFIEZdytFrEbVFFAm1mxOISUQCaTQt7Rse72-GfHx8QL7F7fGGvc6mJRX_X5LhMN9-A4khIsAC3YbznE_24Jq4OokqpDjfwlTrEgZdEKGJb1xBA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Very simple question with a good takeaway, no users experienced bugs whilst interacting with and watching the program.

### Easy to Learn

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vYpI0Sdn2Er-oiqYzifrr3zRqp7bRz-F3Z9xkDpy-uDVNex6PuAq7E1mHTtbxJ7xJkG2CVAFc5_DNnZRBKB7i5RSDHNPYB3s7FlmTx3U7NXZ_MG4qCPsa9R3J27rcYTuWB43c_4nr5aS4Eq65mRB_YUdjtl69hCNhEQ5oDsJtQRIIwQ2C4qHmX8nNA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question enquires into the visual clarity and text on top of the evolution scene. Almost all of the users understood what was going on in the evolution scene, with only one outlier.

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/yFApwnpo9f3QNAKGkZRENE8BvRVGd_y2z-JLmtR2XTtNcL2OVWr3Kq3MZEhXdAwmIBoTLo95HRsNrbEf3EjwsfFru4Di7gtlBsg5g4RDNhcc-a8t6KOBjOMw7coov1tyb7P3lPVsRbIF3iJDNKNc7s1rXJIi1W2-11WYO2tlI7qhh5QtMNEja35UaQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question specifically asks if the user knows the goals of the creatures during the evolution. This is the most important part of of the project for the user to understand. The majority of the users understood the creatures goal.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 18        | The content of the project is suitable for schools. |
| 19        | The project has educational concepts and content.   |
| 20        | The project runs smoothly and without any lag.      |
| 22        | The visual design of the project is simple.         |

### Criterion 18

<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f4yAhVsbUuyB3NXb31Kcytck0FPfXegMuXcXkKCkyzIjj_y4XMJ0X6CBhFbRH0vNs-2MDi1f9MHVTsRFOhOSKwK40KztE5EzCkfc2nPEMYLkTu5jWuL8XTTqWcIeZuH8GjuzRzkCW9D_O0NrgHA0ud4t_fUqfo5zEy3XGz99ZdiltXgZeZRPdkIiGA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The age range I was aiming my project at was higher primary school and secondary school. The users were split on whether or not the project was suitable for primary or not. I am certain that the content is suitable for all ages and that it is the ease of use holding the project back from definitively being suitable for primary schools.

### Criterion 19

<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rBPgD5Ao_ZzEyQVXBDZtNLLIB9D6jEV9X_sVdeetqFjK7v6rQNRYhboxluPbSSYhIn0n0S7vfnfXuSD9JL1Wf8QWMS67LBbmKmqftydDy-OZG1pcRd3SwLxYe9QWfasNAva8p2yLjARMp6bL6tEI2Wtf-uMIZV2L_Lhw4Bwg7kFe-4S-8hrHKEoEjA" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Another goal of the project was to be educational in nature. I imbedded this into the design of the project directly, trying to make the creatures somewhat mimic real life evolution, and also gave the user an overview of how the project links to real life evolution. This was enough for all the users to consider the project as educational.

### Criterion 20

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CZXTdmSOsX8b-yZY5ioBgTxH2kCybmrfthLWJ-NH0QFIiKwv7Ib1OuAeCxqgdFtDwKm8KzdgzrlCAfmJBLNQJFZTl6stIj6T4gDSm6fJluqEB-mpIJzFtyG6bfZuG_AiZhrG7fapK4Hf4_P7mgda-EQ-4Yc8bhMydp8YGBLG31UQrpujnbLl5FpOIw" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This question was designed to prompt the user weather they experienced any lag or low frame rates during their interaction with the program. All but one user reported good performance, and the one user who didn't had a follow up question to explain.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The follow up question reveals that the reason behind the lag was creating a large creature, which I've identified as the only known potential cause of lag I found during my own testing. This user, however, did understand quickly that the large creature caused the bad performance, and despite the lag the simulation still ran.

### Criterion 22

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_lt01j1AvQshUmZdd8_G5IDCHGwTP2bgyM4g-fw1Abb4S-sWdZnwfjeJA5G7exDzwvaZ2o12OPhTmU_DHopU2ONV3D4R4RnrycgD3r79rlGUaiUwvlLXBmHtCpFgA2anKOanairEq4loDFgWwXSSSL022WT26gv5G_YwA_9-NTbEAuAu5eL1MFtzNQ" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For this criterion, I simply asked the user if they considered the visuals simplistic, which they all responded "yes", which gives a good indication that the project has successfully created a minimalistic visual identity.
