# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

I have three success criteria that relate to robustness and reliability. These criteria don't define a frame rate so I will say 30fps is the lowest I should allow, as any lower becomes obviously slow to the user.

| Criterion | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3         | Must be quick enough to run smoothly in runtime.          |
| 20        | The game must be stable and run correctly.                |
| 21        | The game must keep a good frame rate on low end machines. |

### Criterion 3

Criterion 3 refers to the neural networks ability to run smoothly during runtime. The neural networks' size only increases with constraints, and takes up more memory with each constraint, as each individual network has 7 \* amount of constraint nodes, and this network is created 32 times creating 224 nodes total for each constraint created. This can get quite large quickly, with \
\
10 constraints \* 7 \* 32\
\= 135680 bytes\
\
45 constraints \* 7 \* 32\
\= 2626560 bytes
