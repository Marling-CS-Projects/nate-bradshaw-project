# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* The project is only playable on a browser.
* The browser environment caps performance, disallowing potential large creatures.
* Lack of substantial speed up means that users have to watch for long amounts of time.
* A large amount of creature designs fail due to being "too flat"
* No camera controls
* Lack of fully integrated educational content

## Maintenance

Depending on what the future of this project entails, maintenance would vary.

### Current Platform and Size

To keep the project within its current scope and limitations of a browser would be a less intensive maintenance plan that could be realistically be completed by a single person over a short time span. The goals would focus on including more educational value alongside expanding the UI and feedback for the user, such as neural network visualisations and graphs showing improvements to the creatures over the whole evolution. \
\
The advantage of this is that the code could be hosted publicly on GitHub for anyone to run within their website, widening the ease of access for educational institutions to access the project.

### Growing the Scope

If the project was moved beyond the current scope, I believe moving the project outside of a browser and making it into an executable would be needed. This would allow the program to have access to more resources alongside making saving and loading creatures more practical and reliable, whereas on a webpage version this would be much less reliable. Alongside this, I would need to consider changing the physics engine or creating logic for simulating generations much faster with the current one, allowing uses to create a creature and almost instantly see an endpoint of the evolution. For this development plan, potentially having an extra person working on the project could make the higher workload manageable. Potential features could include custom evolution scenes, a variety of infographics, more options for creating the creature and many more fine tune controls for every aspect of the simulation and neural network.\
\
The advantage of this approach would be allowing the project to grow and evolve in its own way as features that were unsuitable or imposable before can be added, but at the expense on accessibility, as schools can sometimes restrict what software is downloaded to their machines.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

#### Reliability

Some aspects of the project are somewhat unreliable in some edge cases, for example the DOM elements can be hidden with a very small window size. ADD MORE

### Long Term Addressing Limitations
