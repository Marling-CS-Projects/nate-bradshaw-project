# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Create clear indicators for the agent ai improvements. | Success      |
| 2           | Keep the user engaged with the agents improvements.    | Success      |

### Feature 1

The user is easily able to observe the distance that the creature made alongside the general performance of the creatures and use that to compare to future generations due to the short time between generations and the improvement being visual in nature. However, a lot more development could be put into this improvement indicators, like displaying the previous generations best creatures score or making graphs and over informatics for the user, which are features I ran out of time before I could implement.

### Feature 2

User feedback indicated that the majority of users were engaged with the simulation. This would be due to the visuals of the simulation being enjoyable to watch, enhanced by the interaction features allowing the user to highlight a creature and change the speed of the simulation. A few more improvements could be a visualisation of a neural network diagram or a user controlled camera.
