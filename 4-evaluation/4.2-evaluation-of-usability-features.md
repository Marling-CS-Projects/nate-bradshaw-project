# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Create clear indicators for the agent ai improvements. | Success      |
| 2           | Keep the user engaged with the agents improvements.    | Success      |

### Feature 1

The user is easily able to observe the distance that the creature made alongside the general performance of the creatures and use that to compare to future generations due to the short time between generations and the improvement being visual in nature. However, a lot more development could be put into this improvement indicators, like displaying the previous generations best creatures score or making graphs and over informatics for the user, which are features I ran out of time before I could implement.

### Feature 2

User feedback indicated that the majority of users were engaged with the simulation. This would be due to the visuals of the simulation being enjoyable to watch, enhanced by the interaction features allowing the user to highlight a creature and change the speed of the simulation. A few more improvements could be a visualisation of a neural network diagram or a user controlled camera.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a easy to use UI.                  | Success      |
| 2           | Make the creature setup straight forward. | Success      |

### Feature 1

The UI was designed to be simplistic and easy to understand, allowing easy expansion and changes alongside being very readable.

### Feature 2

The creature creation scene is very easy to follow. There are only two different elements that you can create the creature out of and they interact with each other simplistically and intuitively. For example, after clicking on one joint with a muscle, a line is drawn to the mouse to give visual feedback to the player on what they are doing.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a variety of start conditions for the player to customise.      | Success      |
| 2           | Include speed controls whilst keeping the integrity of the simulation. | Success      |

### Feature 1

I have provided 3 different scenarios for the creatures to evolve in, user set generation length and custom creature designs to the user, allowing for a very large amount of starting conditions that promotes replay value.

### Feature 2

The speed controls in the simulation, although limited with speeding up the simulation, provide the user with the ability to slow a generation down massively and observe fine details and movements of the creatures whilst the creatures act as they should due to linearly scaling down the muscle movement speed and physics engine.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                          | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | The simulation doesn't crash.        | Success      |
| 2           | Try to remove as many bugs as I can. | Success      |

### Feature 1

Throughout all of my testing and the usage, the simulation was error tolerant and no unresolved crashes were witnessed.

### Feature 2

The simulation runs as expected most of the time, with the only bugs observed being related to the physics engine. I've removed many bugs relating to the creatures finding ways to break the engine in strange ways, such as spinning really fast or phasing through the floor. I've got the interactions to be acceptably stable, even if the creatures sometimes slightly glide across or clip into the floor, the effects are acceptably minimal.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a tutorial.                                                      | Fail         |
| 2           | Keep the design, visually and logically, simple and easy to understand. | Success      |

### Feature 1

I failed to create a tutorial due to the extra effort it would take to integrate it into the program. Instead, I created a guide on the home page of the website that the user can read to understand and use the simulation.

### Feature 2

The visual design succeeded in being simplistic, with the creatures just being single colour lines and circles. This simple design allows the chaos of 32 creatures being on screen at once to be somewhat understandable and the leading and selected creatures to be easily highlighted and spotted.
