## ArtBot

![An ai reinforcement learning level](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

### Overview

ArtBot is a machine learning game where the player sets initial conditions for an agent to complete a level through reinforcement learning. The object of a level is to pick up the two statues and whilst no touching any spikes. The player can interact with the simulation by changing the weighted values for key objects in the scene, such as spikes, the statues and the exit. The agent visually tries multiple paths and invisibly assigns weight values to different path nodes until it can find the best path to pick up both statues and reach the door.

### Player Weights

The players main interaction with the game is setting weights of the rewards and penalties for spikes, statues and the door to change the outcome of the simulation. For example, the player can set spikes as high reward, so the agent will learn to path into them, or the door could be set to high reward, so the agent prioritises the door over picking up both statues. This allows the player to feel more engaged and have fun watching the outcomes of the simulation.

### Rewards / Penalties

ArtBot uses the previously mentioned player set weights create a reward / penalty system for the agent which influences the most desired path for the agent as a direct consequence of the players interaction with the simulation game.

### Educational Content

ArtBot is an educational game aimed to help kids with understanding the concepts of reinforcement learning though an involved interactive experience, and makes the learning an integrated part of the simulation.

### Controls

ArtBot only uses the mouse for controls.

| Embedded Educational Content | The core part of my project is including educational content within my game whilst creating an engaging simulation.                          |   |
| Machine learning             | Machine learning will create the core gameplay similar to ArtBot and creates a unique user experience, which I can create my own version of. |   |
| Penalties and Rewards        | Including goals and obstacles for the ai creates more depth to the simulation and more repayable.                                            |   |
| Additional objectives        | Similar to penalties and rewards, including a secondary objective helps create depth and more interesting simulations.                       |   |

| Reinforcement Learning | Reinforcement learning is the wrong type of machine learning that I want to implement.                                                               |
| 3D Art Style           | A 3D game would be harder to create and I want to focus on the machine learning. Also 3D graphics could be to much to run a school computer browser. |
| Grid Movement          | I don't want to limit my agents to a grid and instead implement free movement in two axis.                                                           |

## Breve Creatures

![Evolution in Breve Creatures](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

### Overview

Breve Creatures is a screensaver for older versions of windows that evolved a series of creatures with the goal of moving as far from the origin in a set timeframe. The game would also change the physical shape and amount of joints of the creature during the runtime.

### Machine Learning

Breve Creatures doesn't use neural networks for controlling creatures, and instead uses a "sine-based controller equations with evolved parameters embedded in the directed graphs." To control the creatures in runtime.

### Evolving Body

Between the generations, the creature can gain or loose limbs as part of the semi random evolution alongside changing its behaviour, and based on the success of such changes, it adapts, once again semi randomly, to the next generation.

### Controls

Breve Creatures is fully automatic, and requires and doesn't accept any inputs.

| Evolution           | Computer powered evolution is fun and interesting to observe and would create a memorable experience if implemented correctly.             |
| Movement Based Goal | Making movement the aim for the agents is a simple yet effective goal that is simple enough for simple machine learning to overcome.       |
| Automatic Evolution | Evolution happening automatically after each generation based on what did the best in the last is a good idea to create a competent agent. |

| Lack of Any Player Control | Having a lack of any player interaction creates an uninvolved and boring experience, which I want to avoid. |
| 3D Creatures               | 3D creatures would take longer to get moving and require more complex environments and coding.              |
| Graphics                   | Breve Creatures has a distinct 2000's style that I believe can be surpassed by modern graphics.             |

## Spore

![Spore](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Overview

Spore is a game that uses the concept of evolution in a very player centred way, with the gameplay loop revolving around interacting with other creatures in the world and gain evolution points to change your creature. The evolution in this game isn't machine learning based but player controlled, with each new generation allowing the player to make changes to their species. Spore is rated as 12+ by PEGI.

### Controls

Spore uses WASD for movement along with a few others for sneaking and a special ability, but in the creature edit mode, it uses a click and drag system with some other hotkeys, such as ctrl-z to undo and alt-click to clone a body part, creating a good system for creating a creature from a variety of parts with ease.

### Evolution System

In the first 2 phases of the game, you gain DNA points through gameplay and discover different features and creature addons, which you can add to your species during the game. Depending on the other creatures you are in the world with, the player also has to adapt with what fight or flight body parts to add or upgrade to deal with the randomised ai threats.

### Food

In the first phase of the game, the player is a cell and can eat food pellets or other cells to grow and evolve while being hunted by bigger cells. Although the ai eats and competes for food, it is not from machine learning and rather is hard coded.

| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creature editor                     | The Spore creature creator is intuitive and easy to use with a click and drag system that adds limbs to the main body mass. An intuitive system allows the player to express creativity and within the game.                    |
| Player controlled creature creation | Player controlled creature creation is the main feature of spore and what makes the game enjoyable for many people, as creating an outlandish creature and seeing how it does within the game is very fun for many players      |
| Reward System                       | Spore has a reward system for the player going out and finding food to progress, and using the points game to customise and evolve their creature, However the reward incentive can be applied to unlocks and machine learning. |
| Re-contextualising evolution        | Spore re-contextualises its evolution system through different objectives. This makes the systems in spore more fun and expansive due to being applied to different situations.                                                 |

| 3D graphics           | Spores 3D graphics are a product of its time, although they do somewhat age well, the 2000's graphics still are obvious without a distinctive enough style.            |
| Direct player control | Direct player control of the creatures in spore works in the context of that game, but in a simulation, the player should only be able to control starting parameters. |
| Open world            | Spore has an open world in some of its phases, which will be well beyond the scope of my project.                                                                      |
| Enemy ai              | Spore has ai controlled enemies that compete with the player, but in the simulation I don't plan to include any enemies,                                               |
