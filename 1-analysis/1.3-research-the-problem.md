## Spore

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Overview

Spore is a game that uses the concept of evolution in a very player centred way, with the gameplay loop revolving around interacting with other creatures in the world and gain evolution points to change your creature. The evolution in this game isn't machine learning based but player controlled, with each new generation allowing the player to make changes to their species. Spore is rated as 12+ by PEGI.

### Controls

Spore uses WASD for movement along with a few others for sneaking and a special ability, but in the creature edit mode, it uses a click and drag system with some other hotkeys, such as ctrl-z to undo and alt-click to clone a body part, creating a good system for creating a creature from a variety of parts with ease.

### Evolution System

In the first 2 phases of the game, you gain DNA points through gameplay and discover different features and creature addons, which you can add to your species during the game. Depending on the other creatures you are in the world with, the player also has to adapt with what fight or flight body parts to add or upgrade to deal with the randomised ai threats.

### Food

In the first phase of the game, the player is a cell and can eat food pellets or other cells to grow and evolve while being hunted by bigger cells. Although the ai eats and competes for food, it is not from machine learning and is instead hard coded.
