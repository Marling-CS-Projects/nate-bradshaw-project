## Spore

![](../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

### Overview

Spore is a game that uses the concept of evolution in a very player centred way, with the gameplay loop revolving around interacting with other creatures in the world and gain evolution points to change your creature. The evolution in this game isn't machine learning based but player controlled, with each new generation allowing the player to make changes to their species. Spore is rated as 12+ by PEGI.

### Controls

Spore uses WASD for movement along with a few others for sneaking and a special ability, but in the creature edit mode, it uses a click and drag system with some other hotkeys, such as ctrl-z to undo and alt-click to clone a body part, creating a good system for creating a creature from a variety of parts with ease.

### Evolution System

In the first 2 phases of the game, you gain DNA points through gameplay and discover different features and creature addons, which you can add to your species during the game. Depending on the other creatures you are in the world with, the player also has to adapt with what fight or flight body parts to add or upgrade to deal with the randomised ai threats.

### Food

In the first phase of the game, the player is a cell and can eat food pellets or other cells to grow and evolve while being hunted by bigger cells. Although the ai eats and competes for food, it is not from machine learning and is instead hard coded.

| Feature                             | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Creature editor                     | The Spore creature creator is intuitive and easy to use with a click and drag system that adds limbs to the main body mass. An intuitive system allows the player to express creativity and within the game.                    |
| Player controlled creature creation | Player controlled creature creation is the main feature of spore and what makes the game enjoyable for many people, as creating an outlandish creature and seeing how it does within the game is very fun for many players      |
| Reward System                       | Spore has a reward system for the player going out and finding food to progress, and using the points game to customise and evolve their creature, However the reward incentive can be applied to unlocks and machine learning. |
| Re-contextualising evolution        | Spore re-contextualises its evolution system through different objectives. This makes the systems in spore more fun and expansive due to being applied to different situations.                                                 |

{% tab title="Features I won't Include" %}
| Feature               | Justification                                                                                                                                                          |

| 3D graphics           | Spores 3D graphics are a product of its time, although they do somewhat age well, the 2000's graphics still are obvious without a distinctive enough style.            |
| Direct player control | Direct player control of the creatures in spore works in the context of that game, but in a simulation, the player should only be able to control starting parameters. |
| Open world            | Spore has an open world in some of its phases, which will be well beyond the scope of my project.                                                                      |
| Enemy ai              | Spore has ai controlled enemies that compete with the player, but in the simulation I don't plan to include any enemies,                                               |
