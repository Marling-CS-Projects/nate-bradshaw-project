## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is the processes of filtering away characteristics of a problem that are irrelevant to help concentrate on core details. Within development this is very important, as you, as the designer and programmer, will face a lot of problems that will need to be abstracted, but can also be very important with considering what to show the user through graphics and interfaces, and what to keep hidden for simplicity. Some features I will abstract visually for the user will be:

* Neural network maps. A visualisation of the weights and outcomes and what they mean for an agent would be a great feature to include and would require abstraction from complicated coding and a visualisation for a user inexperienced in neural networks to view and understand.
* Graphics. Simplicity is the focus of the graphics, as the agents will be no more than 2D circles and rectangles that can be rendered as single coloured blocks to save both on browser performance and visual clarity
* Generations. The generational structure to the neural networks isn't close to being accurate to the inspiration for the simulation, real life evolution. Conceptually, the use of neural networks is an abstraction that is being visually applied to agents.
* User Interface. The user interface needs to have simplistic visuals and purposes through buttons and potentially sliders.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead and having good planning for this project would be implementing core features of the simulation before adding supplementary features, so that the program works as soon as possible to add more leeway to any setbacks.\
\
Furthermore, keeping consistency through planning each step of the way to make sure the user has no unnecessary confusion when interacting with the full project.
