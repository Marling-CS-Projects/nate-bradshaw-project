# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Students

Student learning can be majorly boosted by an inclusion of learning based games into a curriculum. Video games by their nature are made to be engaging and enjoyable, and when implemented educationally, the engagement and enjoyment can be applied to educational material and enhance learning for most students. However, considerations need to be made for educational games to properly embed educational content and stay engaging. Too boring and the game may not assist in learning, and equally, if the game is too engaging in the wrong way, with gameplay taking president over any educational content, the student would also not take away much educational value [(Royle, 2008)](../analysis/references.md).\

A balance between gameplay and educational content must be made, with the game design having to consider how much educational content can be implemented before gameplay becomes too unengaging [(Ibrahim et al., 2012)](../analysis/references.md).

## Teachers

Lesson planning with educational video games can save teachers time and reduce workload, as the nature of educational video games being self explanatory for students to use means the teacher doesn't need to spend as much time planning and supervising a lesson [(Felicia, 2020)](../analysis/references.md).

School IT resources can vary quite a lot with the amount and quality of hardware available for students to use, therefore a consideration for computer specifications needs to be made, with the most desirable being a web game, allowing most schools to access it.

## Ratings

It is always important to consider game ratings and description when designing a game. Due to the nature of educational games, the content should never exceed an a rating of 7 to keep the games content suitable to school, with no foul language or excessive violence.
