# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Movement

The player is not planned to have direct control over the agents, with their movement being being driven by joints, muscles and machine learning. The muscles, that the player can place, will be able to exert a force by expanding or contracting (like a pair of muscles) to move the joints. I believe this movement system will give a big amount of variety for the player to initially create a creature and for the agents to evolve differing movement patterns.

### Controls

The player won't have direct control over the agents, but should be given options to speed up, slow down and pause the simulation in the UI among other options.

### Physics

A physics library that can handle 2D physics such as gravity, circles, joints and muscles, with multiple of these collisions happening concurrently on different agents. I will also need collision layers to make sure collisions only happen when needed to make the simulation more stable and efficient.

## Educational Content

### Balance Between Simulation

Finding the balance between the simulation and educational content is very important for retaining attention and interest whilst the simulation has got educational value [(Royle, 2008)](../analysis/references.md). I believe that the best way to embed educational content is through the gameplay, so the concept of an evolution sim, so it conceptually represents&#x20;

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
