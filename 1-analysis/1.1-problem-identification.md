# 1.1 Problem Identification

Over the past couple of years, British schools have been inconsistently in and out of lock down caused by the COVID19 pandemic. The effect of this on students is clear, learning loss.

The learning loss in months is significantly worse among secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds, such as those eligible for free school meals, who have lost more learning, with a -23.8 compared to a -10.5 from their peers. A disparity also occurs with children who have learning disabilities who have also lost a lot of learning, with a -23.2 score [(Department for Education, 2021)](../analysis/references.md).

Due to the lost time and learning caused by the pandemic, students are left needing to catch up with the curriculum, and one way is to implement new teaching strategies to accelerate learning post COVID19.

One way to accelerate learning to catch up with lost time is by boosting student engagement, especially among those with learning disabilities. This can be done through a variety of means, but from a computing angle, video games are very engaging and can be mixed with learning to increase engagement by a significant amount [(Annetta et al., 2009)](../analysis/references.md). Research also shows that these strategies can also significantly help students with disadvantages such as learning disabilities grasp concepts through self guided exploration of a concept through an entertaining medium, such as a simulation or game [(Simpson, 2009)](../analysis/references.md).

An engaging simulation or game can help learning massively [(Kardan and Conati, 2015)](../analysis/references.md) and boost a students progress, which is greatly needed in the current post COVID19 learning environment.
