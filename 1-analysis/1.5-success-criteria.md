| 2        | Evolution system uses generations.                   | For the concept the game is meant to embody, using generations shows how evolution in real life works over a longer period of time. | [Features of Proposed Solution](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) |
| 3        | Must be quick enough to run smoothly in runtime.     | I need to use neural networks in a way that doesn't effect performance with multiple agents moving at the same time.                | [Features of Proposed Solution](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) |
| 4        | Should be able to handle changing bodies.            | I want the agents physical bodies to change alongside the neural networking to give a more visual indication of evolution.          | [Features of Proposed Solution](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) |
| 5        | Must be able to change smartly with each generation. | I need the neural network to change correctly with each generation to indicate improvements.                                        | [Features of Proposed Solution](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) |

| 7        | Speed controls.                                     | Speed controls would allow the user to either closely observe a generation or skip over multiple generations to see a later one. | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md) |
| 8        | Clear menu for selecting different environments.    | I want the user to be able to easily select the starting environment and objective for the agents.                               | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md) |
| 9        | Clear way of seeing the neural network of an agent. | The user should be able to see a visual representation of an agents neural network during runtime.                               | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md) |
| 10       | Generation and time graphic.                        | The user should be able to see what generation they are viewing and the runtime of the generation and whole program.             | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md) |
| 11       | Informative graphs.                                 | At the end, the user should see informative graphs showing the progression of the agents through all the generations.            | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md) |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

| 12       | The game must be suitable for schools.                    | As I intent for my project to be used educationally, it needs to be appropriate for school environments.                                            | [Stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md)                                        |
| 13       | The game must be stable and run correctly.                | The game must run well despite potentially multiple agents being calculated for each frame, and stable performance in crucial to holding attention. | [Computational Methods](1.4b-computational-methods.md)                     |
| 14       | The game must keep a good frame rate on low end machines. | School hardware can often be on the underpowered side, so I need my game to run well on low end machines.                                           | [Stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md)                                        |
| 15       | The game must have a simple design                        | Due to my focus, I want the visuals to a simple as posable to give me the most development time.                                                    | [Features of Proposed Solution](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) |
