| 1         | Use of neural networks.                             | As the core of the game, neural networks must be utilised for ai decision making.                                                   | Cycle 8   |
| 2         | Evolution system uses generations (neuroevolution). | For the concept the game is meant to embody, using generations shows how evolution in real life works over a longer period of time. | Cycle 10  |
| 3         | Must be quick enough to run smoothly in runtime.    | I need to use neural networks in a way that doesn't effect performance with multiple agents moving at the same time.                | Cycle 11  |
| 4         | Agents with moving bodies and joints.               | I want the agents physical bodies to change alongside the neural networking to give a more visual indication of evolution.          | Cycle 8   |
| 5         | Neuroevolution smartly evolves the neural network.  | I need the neural network to change correctly with each generation to indicate improvements.                                        | Cycle 10  |

| 6         | Side scrolling camera that follow agents.                   | To give more space for the agents to move, the camera should be able to move and follow them of the starting screen | Cycle 9 (i think)  |
| 7         | Zooming                                                     | Zoom controls should be given to the player to let them focus on 1 agent or see the whole picture.                  | Not met            |
| 8         | The player has the option to add obstacles.                 | The inclusion of obstacles would bring variety into simulations.                                                    | Cycle 13           |
| 9         | Option for different Objectives, such as reaching a peak Y. | Similar to the different obstacles, different objectives would spice up gameplay.                                   | Cycle 13           |
| 10        | Win / Lose Conditions                                       | Win or lose conditions for the ai would incentivise different neural network creations                              | Not met            |

| 12        | Speed controls.                                     | Speed controls would allow the user to either closely observe a generation or skip over multiple generations to see a later one. | Cycle 15        |
| 13        | Clear menu for selecting different environments.    | I want the user to be able to easily select the starting environment and objective for the agents.                               | Cycle 13?       |
| 14        | Clear way of seeing the neural network of an agent. | The user should be able to see a visual representation of an agents neural network during runtime.                               | Not met         |
| 15        | Generation and time graphic.                        | The user should be able to see what generation they are viewing and the runtime of the generation and whole program.             | Cycle 9 and 15? |
| 16        | Informative graphs.                                 | At the end, the user should see informative graphs showing the progression of the agents through all the generations.            | Not met         |
