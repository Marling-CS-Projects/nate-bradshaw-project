# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Machine Learning

### Criteria

| Criterion | Criterion                                                  | Reference   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Use of neural networks.                                    | Cycle 8     |
| 2         | Evolution system uses generations (neuroevolution).        | Cycle 10    |
| 3         | Neural network is quick enough to run smoothly in runtime. | Cycle 11    |
| 4         | Agents with moving bodies and joints.                      | Cycle 6 / 8 |
| 5         | Neuroevolution smartly evolves the neural network.         | Cycle 10    |

### Criterion 1

I implemented neural networks in cycle 8 and demonstrated its use with the creatures moving based their muscles based on the lengths of the muscles.

### Criterion 2

I used generations for the evolution successfully by resetting the creatures at an interval with a randomised brain from the best creature of the last generation, and improvement was observed from this. (EVIDENCE NEEDED)

### Criterion 3

From my tests I've found that the neural network is quick enough to run well in runtime, demonstrated in: [3.1-robustness.md](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md "mention").

### Criterion 4

Use of generations
{% endembed %}

I have designed a system where each creatures body has a range of movement from just expanding and contracting their muscles.

### Criterion 5

Showcase of both generation objectives showing evolution
{% endembed %}

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The peak Y of the best and second best creatures over 50 generations</p></figcaption></figure>

From testing the simulation by leaving it running for 50 generations for both moving to the right and jumping, I believe that evolution occurs. The graph above shows the data from the peak Y showcase within the video. From the data you can see an anomaly in generation 0, as the random neural network got very lucky. From there you can see gradual improvement from with a few dips until the 24th generation, where the mutation for that generations neural network caused a massive decrease in performance, which was then evolved on upwards from there to the end of the evolution. This does highlight an issue with my neuroevolution model, but it still demonstrates neural network improvement.

## Mechanics

### Criteria

| Criterion | Criterion                                 | Reference |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 6         | Side scrolling camera that follow agents. | Cycle 9   |
| 7         | Camera zooming.                           | Not met   |
| 8         | Obstacles option.                         | Cycle 13  |
| 9         | Jump option.                              | Cycle 13  |
| 10        | Win / Lose Conditions                     | Not met   |

### Criterion 6

\*video / gif\*

I achieved this goal where the camera follows the best performing creature.

### Criterion 7

This goal was not met due to it being unnecessary, as the creatures are often on the screen together and for simplicity, as p5js doesn't have a camera, and instead I need to move all objects in the scene using a function, which is a bit unintuitive to work with.

### Criterion 8

IMAGE NEEDED

I added the obstacle option to give users an incentive to watch the creatures evolve more than once.

### Criterion 9

IMAGE NEEDED

I added the jump option as it is completely different evolution goal from the other two modes, showing of completely unique movement from the creatures.

### Criterion 10

This goal was not reached due to it being unsuitable for the project. The creatures goal is abstract, being that they need to get the furthest they can in a direction, thus a hard cut-off where a creature "wins" is not needed. Furthermore, creatures don't really have a lose condition, as the bad performing creatures of a generation are just not taken into account at all.

## User Interface

### Criteria

| Criterion | Criterion                                              | Reference         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 11        | Clear and easy to use UI.                              | Cycle 6 / 14 / 15 |
| 12        | Speed controls.                                        | Cycle 15          |
| 13        | Clear menu for selecting different environments.       | Cycle 13          |
| 14        | Clear way of seeing the neural network of an agent.    | Not met           |
| 15        | Generation and time graphic.                           | Cycle 10 / 15     |
| 16        | Informative graphs that show the whole neuroevolution. | Not met           |

### Criterion 11

screenshot

The UI is very self explanatory and easy to use, as shown by the responses from the testers in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention").

### Criterion 12

screenshot

I managed to only partially implement my idea of speed controls, as the physics engine has reliability issues with even 1.5x time scale, but I was able to implement full slow monition that the user can set.

### Criterion 13

screenshot

Similar to having clear UI, the dropdown for selecting the simulation environment is easy to use and intuitive, as multiple other websites and applications use dropdowns

### Criterion 14

This criterion was not met due to time constraints and being low priority compared to making the or user interaction.

### Criterion 15

screenshot

I added some text, which is rather simplistic for a graphic, but it conveys the same information.

### Criterion 16

Once again, time constraints and not having implemented any end to the simulation meant this criterion was unsuitable to work on.

## Non-functional

### Criteria

| Criterion | Criterion                                    | Reference                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 18        | Content suitable for schools.                | Usability testing                   |
| 19        | Embedded Educational Content.                | Usability testing                   |
| 20        | Stable and accurate performance.             | Cycle 11 / Usability testing        |
| 21        | Acceptable frame rate on lower end machines. | Testing for Function and Robustness |
| 22        | Simple visual design.                        | Usability testing                   |

### Criterion 18

screenshot

There is nothing unsuitable for school children included in this project, and referring to the PEGI guidelines indicates a PEGI 3 rating, as there is no violence, bad language or fear inducing content (LINK???), which is also agreed on by the testers [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention")

### Criterion 19

I believe the concepts at play in this project can be considered educational, as the project could reasonably be used to supplement computing science learning as an example of a neural network or for biology as a concept for real life evolution.

### Criterion 20

As shown in [cycle-1-10.md](../design-and-development/cycle-1-10.md "mention"), the program can run seemingly indefinitely without any accumulating memory leak. Additionally, when lag is encountered, the simulation slows down and the physics stay stable and accurate (PROOF????)

### Criterion 21

From my testing in [3.1-robustness.md](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md "mention"), I found that frame rate may suffer on low end machines with larger amounts of joints and muscles, but despite lag, the simulation still ran and demonstrated evolution.

### Criterion 22

The visual design of the project is very simple by design, with very little colour and simple shapes. This is shown by the feedback in [3.2-usability-testing.md](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md "mention"), which agrees that the project has a simple visual design.
